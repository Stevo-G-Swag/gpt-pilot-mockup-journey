# GPT-Pilot Development Roadmap

This roadmap contains a series of prompts that can be used sequentially to build out the GPT-Pilot application. Each prompt builds upon the previous implementations.

## Phase 1: Core Editor Enhancement âœ…

1. âœ… "Add Monaco Editor integration to replace the current mock code editor. Include syntax highlighting for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Make sure it's responsive and maintains the current dark theme."

2. âœ… "Implement file tree navigation in a collapsible sidebar on the left side of the code editor. Include sample files and folders with icons for different file types."

3. âœ… "Add a tab system above the code editor to handle multiple open files. Include close buttons and an indicator for unsaved changes."

## Phase 2: AI Integration âœ…

4. âœ… "Implement a proper chat history system with message persistence using local storage. Add timestamps and the ability to clear chat history."

5. âœ… "Add typing indicators and loading states when the AI is 'thinking'. Include smooth transitions and animations for status changes."

6. âœ… "Create an AI suggestions panel that appears inline with the code editor, similar to GitHub Copilot. Include accept/reject buttons for each suggestion."

## Phase 3: Project Management ðŸš§

7. ðŸš§ "Add a project configuration panel where users can set up their project preferences, including language, framework, and coding style guidelines."

8. "Implement a command palette (triggered by Cmd/Ctrl + K) for quick actions like creating new files, searching in project, and running AI commands."

9. "Create a project initialization wizard that helps users set up new projects with recommended folder structures and configuration files."

## Phase 4: Collaboration Features

10. "Add a simple version control interface showing git status, changes, and basic commit/push functionality."

11. "Implement a share feature that generates shareable links to code snippets or entire projects."

12. "Create a comments system that allows adding inline comments to code, with AI-powered suggestions for code improvements."

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

13. "Add a terminal panel at the bottom of the editor for running commands and seeing output. Include command history and autocomplete."

14. "Implement a debug panel with basic debugging controls and variable inspection."

15. "Create a test generation feature where the AI can automatically generate unit tests for selected code."

## Phase 6: Polish & Production

16. "Add proper error handling throughout the application with user-friendly error messages and recovery options."

17. "Implement user authentication and project persistence using a backend service."

18. "Add keyboard shortcuts for all major actions and create a shortcuts reference panel."

19. "Create a responsive design system that works well on tablets and larger phones."

20. "Implement usage analytics and error tracking for production monitoring."

## Phase 7: Performance & Optimization

21. "Optimize the editor performance for large files and implement code splitting for faster initial load times."

22. "Add file search and replace functionality with regex support across the entire project."

23. "Implement caching strategies for AI responses and file content to reduce API calls."

## Final Phase: Production Release

24. "Add a comprehensive onboarding tour for new users highlighting key features."

25. "Implement final security measures including rate limiting and input sanitization."

26. "Create production deployment configurations and documentation."

Each prompt can be given to the AI assistant sequentially to build out the feature. The assistant will implement the requested functionality while maintaining existing features and ensuring code quality.

Note: Some prompts may need to be broken down into smaller sub-tasks depending on complexity.
